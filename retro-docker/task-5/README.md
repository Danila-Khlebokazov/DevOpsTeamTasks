## Task Description

Set up Gitlab CI/CD pipeline that builds docker images for multiple platforms, such
as windows/amd64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64.
Create a reusable CI template that automates the process of building and pushing
docker images. The template should be easily adaptable for various projects and be
configured for different platforms (e.g., Linux/amd64, ARM architectures).
The goal is to create a modular and reusable pipeline configuration that can be
applied across multiple repositories or projects.
Note: pipeline that builds docker images for multiple platforms or selected
platforms
